## Entities

The ERD consists of the following main entities:

1. **User**: Represents a user of the ride-sharing application.
 Each user has an id (unique identifier),
  roles (list of roles like Rider, Driver, Admin),
   name, email, password, and a location.

2. **RideRequest**: Represents a request for a ride made by a user. It has an id, the rider (a User entity), status (pending, accepted, rejected), pick-up location, drop-off location, requested time, payment method, fare amount, and a reference to the Rider user.

3. **Ride**: Represents an actual ride that has been accepted and is in progress. It has an id, references to the Rider and Driver users, status (started, in-progress, completed), pick-up and drop-off locations, start and end times, fare amount, one-time password (OTP) for verification, and payment method.

4. **Payment**: Represents a payment made for a ride. It has an id, reference to the Ride, payment status, and payment time.

5. **Wallet**: Represents a user's wallet for storing money. It has an id, reference to the User, current balance, and a list of payments made.

6. **Rating**: Represents a rating given by a user for a ride. It has an id, references to the Ride and User, and a rating type.

## Relationships

The entities have the following relationships:

1. **User** has a one-to-many relationship with **RideRequest**, **Ride**, **Payment**, **Wallet**, and **Rating**:
   - A user can make multiple ride requests, but each ride request is made by one user.
   - A user can be a rider or driver in multiple rides, but each ride has one rider and one driver.
   - A user can make multiple payments, but each payment is made by one user.
   - A user can have one wallet, and each wallet belongs to one user.
   - A user can give multiple ratings, but each rating is given by one user.

2. **RideRequest** has a one-to-one relationship with **Ride**:
   - Each ride request can be associated with at most one ride, and each ride is associated with one ride request.

3. **Ride** has a one-to-one relationship with **Payment**:
   - Each ride can have at most one payment, and each payment is associated with one ride.

## Example Flow:

1. **Creating a ride request**:
   - User A (rider) creates a new ride request with pick-up location as "123 Main St" and drop-off location as "456 Oak Ave".
   - The ride request is saved with a unique id, User A's id as the rider, pending status, requested time, and other details.

2. **Accepting a ride request**:
   - User B (driver) accepts the ride request made by User A.
   - The ride request status is updated to accepted, and a new ride entity is created with references to User A (rider) and User B (driver).
   - The ride entity also includes the pick-up and drop-off locations, start time, and other details.

3. **Making a payment**:
   - After the ride is completed, a payment entity is created with the ride id, payment status as "pending", and payment time.
   - User A's wallet balance is checked and updated based on the ride fare.
   - If User A has sufficient balance, the payment status is updated to "paid". Otherwise, it remains in "pending" status.

4. **Giving a rating**:
   - After the ride is completed, User A (rider) can give a rating to User B (driver).
   - A new rating entity is created with the ride id, User A's id, and the rating type (e.g., 5 stars).
